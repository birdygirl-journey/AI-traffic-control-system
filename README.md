🚦 AI Traffic Control System

An intelligent traffic signal simulation designed to optimize urban traffic flow using AI-inspired decision logic. This project demonstrates how adaptive traffic control can reduce congestion, improve safety, and save fuel in smart city environments.

📌 Overview

Urban traffic congestion is a growing challenge in modern cities. Traditional traffic signals operate on fixed timers and fail to adapt to real-time road conditions.
The AI Traffic Control System addresses this issue by dynamically allocating green signals based on vehicle density at an intersection.

This project simulates a four-way intersection and uses traffic data to determine which road should receive priority.

🎯 Project Focus & Impact

🚗 Optimizes traffic flow in urban intersections

⏱ Reduces waiting time and congestion

⛽ Saves fuel by minimizing idle time

🚦 Enhances road safety through adaptive control

🌆 Demonstrates AI applications in smart cities

🧠 How It Works

Simulates traffic data for four roads (North, South, East, West)

Counts the number of vehicles on each road

Identifies the road with the highest traffic density

Grants a green signal to the busiest road

Repeats the process across multiple traffic cycles

The logic mimics real-world AI decision-making using simple Python constructs.
