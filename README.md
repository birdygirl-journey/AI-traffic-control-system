 AI Traffic Control System

An intelligent traffic signal simulation designed to optimize urban traffic flow using AI-inspired decision logic. This project demonstrates how adaptive traffic control can reduce congestion, improve safety, and save fuel in smart city environments.

 Overview

Urban traffic congestion is a growing challenge in modern cities. Traditional traffic signals operate on fixed timers and fail to adapt to real-time road conditions.
The AI Traffic Control System addresses this issue by dynamically allocating green signals based on vehicle density at an intersection.

This project simulates a four-way intersection and uses traffic data to determine which road should receive priority.

Project Focus & Impact

= Optimizes traffic flow in urban intersections

=Reduces waiting time and congestion

= Saves fuel by minimizing idle time

= Enhances road safety through adaptive control

= Demonstrates AI applications in smart cities

 How It Works

=Simulates traffic data for four roads (North, South, East, West)

=Counts the number of vehicles on each road

=Identifies the road with the highest traffic density

=grants a green signal to the busiest road

=Repeats the process across multiple traffic cycles

The logic mimics real-world AI decision-making using simple Python constructs.
